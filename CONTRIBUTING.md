# Information for contributors

Please give a descriptive commit message. 

When adding big features, please create a new branch and start a PR. One of the contributors must do a code review before merging the branches.

Also, you must have yarn installed since that is the primary packaging system we use.

The README files should also have basic language and a new programmer should be able to understand it. This library is targetted to new programmers.
