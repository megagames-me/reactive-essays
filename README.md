This is a TypeScript + React.js library, inspired by [Tangle](https://github.com/worrydream/Tangle). This is a tool to make your essays interactive and a systems thinking tool. It can be used by students and can teach them how to use React. 

For more details, please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/megagames-me/reactive-essays/wiki).

## Information for contributors

If you aren't working on this project, skip to the next section.

Please give a descriptive commit message. Also, you must have yarn installed since that is the primary packaging system we have. 

## Dependencies

(Dependencies means what you need for this library to work)

For more information on how to install stuff and other things, please go to the [respective wiki page](https://github.com/megagames-me/reactive-essays/wiki#dependencies) for dependencies. 

### Node.js

This project requires Node.js 16.13.0. It has been tested on 17.0.2. It didn't work. You can install it at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). Click the left button. And then install. **This requires admin access on your computer.**

### Visual Studio Code

Now, you must install an app called Visual Studio Code. It will be the editor we will use to write your code. If you already know how to program, you can skip ahead. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download the stable build, and then install it. Then, you should follow any steps that are requested by the app. After that, you should see a bunch of icons on the right. Click the 5th icon from the top. It should open an extension menu.

Now we must install a few extensions. First, install "JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly" from Microsoft, "HTML CSS Support" from ecmel, "jshint" from Dirk Baeumer, and "TypeScript Extension Pack" by Loiane Groner. Now, you should have all the extensions necessary to code in TypeScript or JavaScript.

**Add more later**

For a more in-depth tutorial, visit [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) site. 

### React.js

This project also requires React.js. When you downloaded Node.js, you also downloaded a command-line tool named `npm`. This is used for managing the different libraries. For example, for using this library you must install React.js through npm.
