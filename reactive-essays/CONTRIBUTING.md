# Information for contributors

Please give a descriptive commit message. 

When adding big features, please create a new branch and start a PR. One of the contributors must do a code review before merging the branches.

Also, you must have yarn installed since that is the primary packaging system we use.

The README files should also have basic language and a new programmer should be able to understand it. This library is targetted to new programmers.

## Programming

The TypeScript source files are in `/src/`. We compile into ESM and CJS in `/lib/`.
The CSS code is in `/lib/css`. Since this is inspired by [Tangle](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/), please make sort of the 'style' like it. But not too outdated.
Also, use Node 16.13.0 for the time being. The contributors will indicate here if we upgrade. However, there are a few issues with React and Node 17. 

### Compiling source files: `yarn build` in root dir

The example reactive-essays app is in `/example/`. It was created by a simple `create-react-app` but with TypeScript. The autogenerated README there has more info. 

### Starting example development server: `yarn start` in `/example/`

If you add a new big feature, add it to the `/example/` app.
